# PointsBot

## Overview
PointsBot is a Reddit bot that monitors posts in a subreddit, awards points to users who solve problems, and updates their flair to reflect their achievement levels. When the original poster marks a comment as solved (e.g., by replying "!Solved"), the bot awards a point to the solver, tracks their progress, and notifies them with a reply comment. Points accumulate to unlock new levels, and progress is visually represented with stars and progress bars.

## Features
- Monitors subreddit posts for solutions
- Awards points to users whose comments are marked as solved
- Updates user flair based on their point level
- Notifies users of their progress and next level
- Prevents awarding points to moderators
- Consolidates points into stars for easier progress tracking
